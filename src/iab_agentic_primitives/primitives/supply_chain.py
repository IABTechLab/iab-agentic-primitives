"""Supply-chain transparency wire primitives (EP-10.3).

Models the OpenRTB (Open Real-Time Bidding) SupplyChain object (``schain``)
and a sellers.json entry so a deal can carry an auditable record of who is
in the monetisation path. These are the industry-standard transparency
objects the two agents must agree on to avoid the undisclosed-reseller and
spoofing problems that ads.txt / sellers.json / schain were created to
solve.

OpenRTB/AdCOM (Advertising Common Object Model) field names are kept
verbatim where they are the published standard — ``asi`` (advertising
system identifier), ``sid`` (seller id within that system), ``hp``
(handled-payment flag), ``rid`` (request id), ``name``, ``domain``,
``ext`` — so an adapter can map to the raw bid-stream encoding without a
rename table. Integer 0/1 flags (``complete``, ``hp``) follow the OpenRTB
encoding rather than being re-typed to bool.

See RECONCILIATION.md at the repo root for the classification decision.
