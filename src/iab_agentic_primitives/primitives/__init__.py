"""Shared wire primitives exchanged between the buyer and seller agents.

Every primitive the two agents exchange is defined exactly once here --
Product, MediaKit, Package, RateCard, Quote, Proposal, Negotiation, Deal,
Order, Line, ChangeRequest, Session, Creative, Assignment, and the identity
objects (Agent, Organization, Account). Agent-local primitives (a buyer's
planning internals, a seller's pricing configuration) stay in their own
repos; only the "both" wire primitives live in this package, which kills
the copy-fork divergence and incompatible-schema problems by making sure
there is exactly one schema for anything that crosses the wire.

Modules:

- ``identity``  -- Organization, Account, Agent, BuyerIdentity, ConsentContext
- ``inventory`` -- Product, MediaKit, Package
- ``pricing``   -- DealType, Curation, pricing enums, linear TV params, RateCard, Quote
- ``lifecycle`` -- Proposal, Negotiation, Deal, Order, Line, ChangeRequest, Session
- ``creative``  -- Creative, CreativeApproval, Assignment
- ``supply_chain`` -- SupplyChain, SupplyChainNode, SellersJsonEntry
- ``audit``     -- DecisionRecord (durable "why did money move" record)

Reconciliation decisions (which repo's shape won, and why) are recorded in
RECONCILIATION.md at the repository root.
