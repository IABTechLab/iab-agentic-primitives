"""Reusable interop assertions over a :class:`TransactionResult`.

These are the anti-regression checks that both agent repos' future CI will
call after running the golden scenarios with their REAL agent swapped in for
a reference one. Each targets a specific historical interop break that a
mocked counterparty hid:

- :func:`assert_quote_roundtrips` — a quote request produced a valid quote
  whose product/deal_type/media_type match what was asked.
- :func:`assert_no_field_dropped` — the ``agent_url`` / ``linear_tv`` /
  ``audience_plan`` regression: fields the buyer sent survive to the response
  (or, for an unsupported capability, are rejected STRUCTURALLY — never
  silently dropped and mispriced).
- :func:`assert_negotiation_terminates` — no infinite 'active': a negotiation
  reaches a terminal status in bounded rounds.
- :func:`assert_booking_has_seller_deal_id` — a booked deal carries a
  seller-minted ``deal_id`` and the seller's id.
- :func:`assert_auth_tier_enforced` — the buyer got exactly the tier the
  registry granted, never a self-asserted higher one.
- :func:`assert_idempotent_booking` — the same idempotency key booked one
  deal, not two.
- :func:`assert_state_consistent` — the buyer's and seller's independently
  tracked deal status reconcile as ``consistent`` (no DisagreementReport).

Every function raises :class:`AssertionError` with a diagnostic message on
failure and returns ``None`` on success, so they drop straight into pytest.

Acronyms: CPM = cost per mille; FD = flagged decision; TV = television.
