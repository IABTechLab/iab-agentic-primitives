"""Role interfaces the two-agent harness plugs real (or reference) agents into.

The harness proves interoperability by running BOTH sides of a transaction
against the ONE shared contract (:mod:`iab_agentic_primitives.protocol` +
:mod:`iab_agentic_primitives.primitives` + :mod:`iab_agentic_primitives.state`
+ the sandbox AAMP — Agentic Advertising Marketplace Protocol — registry),
instead of each repo mocking its counterparty. The mocks are exactly why the
historical interop breaks (negotiation 422-every-round, dropped ``agent_url``
headers, 405 catalog, makegood 404s, incompatible agent cards) stayed
invisible: a mock never disagrees with you.

Two abstract roles capture the buyer/seller split. Every method takes and
returns the canonical protocol envelopes and primitives — there is NO free
text on any money path (offers, quotes, deals, budgets are all
:class:`~iab_agentic_primitives.primitives.Money`):

- :class:`SellerRole` is a passive service: serve the catalog, price a quote
  (honoring a floor and the registry-capped access tier), handle a
  negotiation message, and book a deal (minting the ``deal_id`` and driving
  the Order/Deal state machines). Money-path methods return either the
  success envelope OR the ONE structured
  :class:`~iab_agentic_primitives.protocol.errors.ErrorEnvelope` — never a
  bare exception, never a silently mispriced result.
- :class:`BuyerRole` is the active driver: given a :class:`CampaignBrief` and
  the set of discovered+trusted seller channels, it requests quotes,
  optionally negotiates, enforces its hard budget ceiling, and books —
  returning a :class:`BuyerOutcome`.

A :class:`SellerChannel` is how a buyer reaches ONE seller over the protocol.
In-process the channel wraps a :class:`SellerRole` directly (no socket); in
production the same interface is an HTTP client. Crucially the channel carries
the buyer's registry-verified access-tier CEILING and injects it into every
seller call, so the seller caps the buyer's self-asserted tier server-side —
trust is never self-asserted (see the Agent primitive and
:data:`iab_agentic_primitives.registry_client.TRUST_TIER_CEILING`).

Acronyms: A2A = agent-to-agent protocol; AAMP = the IAB (Interactive
Advertising Bureau) Tech Lab agent discovery and trust registry; CPM = cost
per mille (per thousand impressions); FD = flagged decision.
