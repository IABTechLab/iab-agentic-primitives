"""Key resolution: from ``(origin, keyid)`` to an Ed25519 public key.

:class:`DirectoryResolver` composes a :class:`~.ports.DirectoryFetcher` and a
:class:`~.ports.DirectoryStore`, and owns every rule about what a stored
directory is good for (OpenProposal § 2.8.3):

- It fetches exactly ``https://<host>/.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory``
  and verifies the response with :func:`~.directory.verify_directory` under
  one :class:`~.directory.FetchLimits`, at the time it was fetched.
- A directory is verified once, when it enters the process: from the fetcher,
  or as bytes the store returns that the resolver hasn't verified. The
  resolver holds each :class:`~.directory.VerifiedDirectory` in memory by
  origin, and answers from it while the store returns the response it was
  verified from. Stored bytes it doesn't hold are verified, as fetched, for
  the origin it asked for and under its own limits; a stored response that
  doesn't verify is a cache miss.
- The resolver's own clock stamps each fetch and judges the cache: a
  directory younger than :attr:`CachePolicy.max_cache_age` answers every
  keyid without a fetch. A directory that resolves without the key replaces
  the stored one. A failed fetch does not evict it, and isn't retried for
  :attr:`CachePolicy.negative_ttl` seconds.
- The time a verifier judges at decides only whether the directory still
  holds then: it answers until the earliest ``expires`` among its signatures.
- Concurrent resolves of one origin share one fetch.

Keys are always looked up by the pair ``(origin, keyid)``, never by ``keyid``
alone. :class:`StaticKeyResolver` resolves from keys pinned by configuration,
with no network.

    ``fetcher`` fetches directory responses; without one, the resolver builds
    an :class:`~.fetcher.HttpxDirectoryFetcher` with a plain client and closes
    it in :meth:`aclose`. An injected fetcher belongs to the caller. ``store``
    keeps each origin's directory response; :class:`MemoryDirectoryStore` by
    default. ``limits`` holds the profile's fetch limits, ``cache`` how long a
    directory is kept, and ``clock`` the time the resolver stamps fetches with
    and judges its cache and failures by. Each is fixed when the resolver is
    made.

    A directory is verified once, when it enters the process. The resolver
    holds each verified directory in memory by origin, for a bounded number
    of origins, and answers from it while the store returns the
    response it was verified from, so a cache hit or an unknown keyid costs
    no verification. A stored response it doesn't hold, such as one another
    worker wrote, is verified at the time it was fetched and under
    ``limits``; a response that doesn't verify is a cache miss. A fresh
    directory answers every keyid without a fetch, so an unknown keyid never
    causes one. A stale but valid directory is fetched again; when that fetch
    fails, the stored keys still answer. Only a refusal is a failed fetch; any
    other error propagates and records nothing. A store that raises
    :class:`~.ports.DirectoryStoreUnavailable` is read as holding nothing, so
    the directory is fetched afresh, and its failed writes are logged; neither
    changes the answer. The ``now`` a resolve is
    judged at decides only whether the directory has expired by then
    (``directory-window``); it never stamps or ages the cache.

    A resolver belongs to the event loop it first resolves on, as its fetches
    in flight and its client's connections do: a resolve on another loop
    raises :class:`ConfigurationError`, and so does one after :meth:`aclose`.
    Synchronous code reaches it through one :class:`~.sync.SyncRuntime`.
