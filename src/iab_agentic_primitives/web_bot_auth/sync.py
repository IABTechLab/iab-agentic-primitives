"""Synchronous code and the async verifiers: one loop, owned by whoever owns the resolver.

The verifiers are async, and a :class:`~.resolver.DirectoryResolver` belongs
to the event loop it first resolves on: its fetches in flight and its
client's connection pool live there. :class:`SyncRuntime` is that loop for
synchronous code. It runs one loop on its own thread for its whole life, and
every sync call runs there, so the pool is reused across calls instead of
being stranded on a closed loop.

.. code-block:: python

    resolver = DirectoryResolver()
    with SyncRuntime(resolver) as runtime:
        verifier = SyncRequestVerifier(RequestVerifier(resolver, ...), runtime=runtime)
        verified = verifier.verify(request)

Create one runtime per resolver, where the resolver is created, and pass it
to every façade and :class:`~.httpx.WebBotAuth` that verifies through that
resolver. Closing the runtime cancels the calls still running, which raise
:class:`ConfigurationError`, closes the resolver, and stops the thread.

A sync call made inside a running event loop raises ``RuntimeError``, as
``asyncio.run`` does, instead of blocking that loop: await the verifier there,
or :meth:`SyncRuntime.run_async` for a resolver the runtime owns.

A runtime belongs to the process that made it. A forked child inherits the
runtime but not its thread, so a call there raises :class:`ConfigurationError`
instead of waiting on a loop nothing runs: a pre-fork server (gunicorn
``--preload``) creates the runtime, and the resolver, in each worker.
