"""Thin ASGI helpers: sign responses, serve the signed key directory, and,
opt-in, require a signature.

These are plain ASGI and import no framework, so they work with Starlette,
FastAPI, or any ASGI server.

- :func:`request_url` rebuilds a request's URL on a :class:`ServerIdentity`,
  under the URL rule every signer signs under, so a server that only verifies
  needs nothing more.
- :class:`ServerEdge` is the server's one identity at its edges, with the
  signer, the directory, and the confirmer that depend on it, checked against
  each other once. Both middlewares take it, and :meth:`ServerEdge.request_url`
  rebuilds a request's URL on it, so the request a server verifies and the
  request it binds a response to are rebuilt from one base URL.
- :class:`ResponseSigningMiddleware` signs each buffered response and binds it
  to the request it answers, and serves the directory of the key it signs
  with. It passes streaming responses (``text/event-stream``) through unsigned.
- :class:`DirectoryMiddleware` answers ``GET`` on the well-known directory path
  with the signed key directory of a :class:`~.directory.DirectoryPublisher`,
  for a party that signs no responses. A framework route answers the same with
  :meth:`DirectoryPublisher.answer`.
- :class:`RequireSignatureMiddleware` is opt-in. It verifies inbound
  signatures, refuses failures, and hands the app the :class:`VerifiedRequest`,
  which :func:`verified_request` reads from the scope. An application that
  resolves identity at its own boundary calls :meth:`RequestVerifier.verify`
  there instead.

Every answer the helpers write, refusals included, comes from
:mod:`.presentation`; this module only serializes it to ASGI messages.

    ``Signature-Input`` (:func:`~.verifier.is_signed`). A signed request's body is read up to
    ``max_body_bytes`` (1 MiB by default); a larger one is answered ``413``. A
    request whose signature fails is always refused, with
    :func:`~.presentation.refusal_response`. A verified request reaches the app
    with its :class:`VerifiedRequest`, which :func:`verified_request` reads. It
    is immutable.
