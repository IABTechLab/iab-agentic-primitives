"""The ports of key resolution: what a verifier asks for, and what a resolver composes. No I/O.

- :class:`KeyResolver` is what a verifier calls: ``(origin, keyid)`` at
  ``now`` to a :class:`ResolvedKey`.
- :class:`DirectoryFetcher` fetches a directory response from the network.
- :class:`DirectoryStore` keeps directory responses and failure deadlines as
  plain data, and only keeps them: the resolver verifies bytes it returns
  that it hasn't verified, and decides what a stored directory is still good
  for.

:class:`~.resolver.DirectoryResolver` composes a fetcher and a store;
:class:`~.fetcher.HttpxDirectoryFetcher` and
:class:`~.resolver.MemoryDirectoryStore` are the defaults.
:func:`~.testing.check_directory_store` checks a store against this contract.
