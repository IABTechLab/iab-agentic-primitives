"""httpx clients that sign every request on the wire and verify every signed response.

.. code-block:: python

    async with DirectoryResolver() as resolver:
        auth = WebBotAuth(RequestSigner.of(key, "https://buyer.example.com"),
                          ResponseVerifier(resolver))
        async with auth.async_client() as client:
            response = await client.post(url, json=commit)
            verified = verified_response(response)  # a VerifiedResponse, or None
            outcome = verification(response)  # what the client found out, whatever it was
            sent = sent_request(response)  # the request as signed and sent

:class:`WebBotAuth` is the configuration, and the library builds the client
from it, so the signing transport is always the client's one transport. The
transport signs each wire hop for its own URL and verifies the response to it
against the exact request sent on that hop. A redirect, followed or not, is
signed afresh for its own URL, so a signature never reaches another URI
(OpenProposal § 2.8.2).

The client always returns the response, with what it found out about it: a
:class:`VerifiedResponse`, :class:`Unsigned`, or :class:`VerificationFailed`.
It raises only :class:`ResponseNotVerified`, which carries the response, for a
``2xx`` it couldn't verify when it is told to require signed responses.

A synchronous ``httpx.Client`` verifies on a :class:`~.sync.SyncRuntime` that
the caller owns, passed as ``runtime=``.

    ``signer`` signs every request; with no signer, requests go unsigned,
    for a call that authenticates another way, such as a bearer token, and
    the client still verifies the signed response (:meth:`verify_only`). A
    response to an unsigned request needs no binding.

    With ``response_verifier``, the client decides from a response's header
    lines alone whether it is signed. An unsigned response is returned
    unread, so a stream arrives as it is sent. A signed one is read and
    verified, signature and binding to the request sent on that hop. Either
    way the client returns the response, and :func:`verification` reads what
    it found out: a :class:`VerifiedResponse` (which :func:`verified_response`
    returns), :class:`Unsigned`, or :class:`VerificationFailed`.

    With ``require_signed_response`` (the default), a ``2xx`` response that
    isn't verified raises :class:`ResponseNotVerified`, which carries the
    response. An unsigned response of a media type that ``streaming`` names,
    which a server streams unsigned (:data:`~.rules.STREAMING`,
    ``text/event-stream``, by default; configure the seller's
    :class:`~.rules.Streaming`), is let
    through, and so is every response that isn't a ``2xx``, such as a
    refusal a verifier sends unsigned (``400``, ``403``, ``429``, ``503``),
    a redirect, or a proxy's ``502``: its status, headers, and body are the
    peer's own.

    ``expect`` names whose signature the response carries, as
    :meth:`ResponseVerifier.verify` reads it: ``"same-origin"`` (the
    default), the identity of the host each hop went to; an :class:`Origin`;
    or ``None`` for any identity.

    ``runtime`` is the :class:`~.sync.SyncRuntime` of the verifier's
    resolver, owned by the caller. With it, the client verifies on the
    runtime's loop, so one configuration serves an ``httpx.Client`` and an
    ``httpx.AsyncClient`` alike. Without it, only an async client can
    verify: :meth:`client` raises :class:`ConfigurationError`.

    When it verifies responses, the client sends ``Accept-Encoding:
    identity``: ``Content-Digest`` covers the content as sent. The settings
    are fixed when the configuration is made.
