"""How the module's answers look on the wire: one place for every status, header, and body.

:func:`refusal_response` turns a :class:`~.errors.WebBotAuthError` into the
response a verifier sends: the refusal's status, a JSON body
``{"error": <reason>, "status": <status>}``, ``Accept-Signature`` on ``403``
and ``429``, and ``Retry-After`` on ``503``. The ASGI middlewares send it, and
a framework route returns it. No body carries an error's detail, such as a
directory fetch error or a store's message: the detail is for logs, and the
verifiers log it.

The ASGI helpers' other answers come from here too: ``405`` on the directory
path, ``503`` when a key source publishes no keys, ``413`` for a body over the
limit, and ``500`` for a response the profile can't sign. Each function is
pure and returns an :class:`~.message.Answer`.
