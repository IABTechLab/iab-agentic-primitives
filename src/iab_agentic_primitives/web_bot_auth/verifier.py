"""Verifying requests and responses under the profile.

:class:`RequestVerifier` confirms a request's ``web-bot-auth`` signature and
returns a :class:`VerifiedRequest`; :class:`ResponseVerifier` confirms a
response's and returns a :class:`VerifiedResponse`. Neither decides anything
else: the caller maps ``origin`` to its own stored principal. Only this module
constructs the two credentials, and both are frozen. So are the verifiers.

Both run the steps of WEB_BOT_AUTH.md, "Verification procedure", in its
order. Each step below names the step it implements:

- :func:`_select`: "Parse the fields" and "Select the signature".
- :func:`_check_authority`: "Check the authority", for a request only.
- :func:`_check_parameters`: "Check the parameters".
- :func:`_check_components`: "Check the components".
- :func:`_check_signer`: "Check the signer", for a response only.
- :meth:`_Verifier._authenticate`: "Resolve the key" and "Verify the
  signature".
- :meth:`RequestVerifier._record`: "Check the nonce".
