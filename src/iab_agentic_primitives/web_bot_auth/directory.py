"""The signed key directory: publishing, signing, and verifying it. No I/O.

An identity, an :class:`~.values.Origin`, publishes its keys only at its
``directory_url``, ``https://<host>/.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory``,
as a JWK Set served with the media type
``application/http-message-signatures-directory+json``. Every function here
takes that origin, and derives the URL and the ``"@authority";req`` it signs
or checks from it.

:func:`publish_directory` is the one way to build and sign a directory: once
per Ed25519 key, each signature covering ``"@authority";req`` and
``content-digest`` and carrying ``created``, ``expires``, the key's thumbprint
as ``keyid``, ``alg="ed25519"``, and ``tag="http-message-signatures-directory"``.
:class:`DirectoryPublisher` publishes a key source that can rotate.

A fetched response is a :class:`DirectoryResponse`. :func:`verify_directory`
verifies it for the origin it was fetched for, in four pure steps, then checks
each key's signature:

1. :func:`check_fetch_rules`: the URL, status ``200``, no
   ``Content-Encoding``, the media type, and the size.
2. :func:`parse_jwk_set`: the body as a JWK Set, to a :class:`KeySet`.
3. The one signature by each key, with the directory tag and components.
4. The directory window, from :data:`rules.DIRECTORY`.

The result is a :class:`VerifiedDirectory` of that origin, which only this
module constructs. Keys of other types, and the signatures they make, are
ignored.
