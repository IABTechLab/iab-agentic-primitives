"""Registry of claimed standards -> what this kit ACTUALLY checks (EP-6.1 §5).

Honesty contract: every standard the shared library claims alignment with
appears here, mapped either to the concrete check kinds the runner
executes, or to an explicit ``unverified`` marker stating exactly what has
not been verified. The gap report always prints this registry, so there
are no silent coverage claims — "we model a field named after the
standard" is NOT the same as "we verified conformance against the
published standard", and this file keeps the two separate.

Statuses:

- ``implemented`` — the runner executes real checks for this claim today.
  These are the contract's own flagged decisions (FD = flagged decision),
  which ARE fully checkable from this repo's spec artifacts.
- ``unverified`` — the claim references an external published standard and
  NO fidelity check against that publication exists yet. The ``missing``
  field says what a future bead must add. External-spec details are never
  fabricated here.
