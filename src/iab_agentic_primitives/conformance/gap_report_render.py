"""Render ``gap_report.json`` as the human-facing STANDARDS_GAP_REPORT.md.

EP-6.2 deliverable. The conformance runner (EP-6.1) emits a machine-readable
``gap_report.json``; this module turns that same data into a durable,
honest, Markdown gap report — the "where are we missing an IAB
(Interactive Advertising Bureau) standard?" document the owner asked for.

Design contract (matches the kit's UNVERIFIED policy):

- The report is a pure function of ``gap_report.json`` plus a static
  remediation table below. No external-spec details are invented: where the
  kit cannot verify against a published external spec, the report says so and
  cites exactly what a future bead must obtain.
- The rendered Markdown is DETERMINISTIC — it deliberately omits the volatile
  ``generated_at`` timestamp so a drift-guard test can assert the checked-in
  file byte-matches a fresh render.

Per-standard status is derived, not stored:

- ``CONFORMANT`` — an ``implemented`` registry entry whose mapped checks ran
  with at least one pass and zero failures.
- ``PARTIAL`` — an ``implemented`` entry with a failing mapped check, or whose
  mapped checks never actually executed (all skipped / absent).
- ``UNVERIFIED`` — a registry entry that references an external published
  standard with no fidelity check against that publication yet.
