"""Negotiation messages: offer / counter / accept / decline (FD-5).

ONE endpoint, ONE message model each way:

- ``POST /api/v1/negotiations/messages`` — the buyer sends a
  :class:`NegotiationMessage`; the seller answers a
  :class:`NegotiationRoundResponse`.
- ``GET /api/v1/negotiations/{negotiation_id}`` — full history; response
  is the :class:`~iab_agentic_primitives.primitives.Negotiation` primitive.

Why this exists — the historical 422: the buyer's
``negotiation/client.py`` POSTed ``{"price": <float>}`` to
``/proposals/{id}/counter`` while the seller's ``CounterOfferRequest``
required ``buyer_price`` and had no ``action`` field at all, so every
round failed validation (HTTP 422) and accept/decline were structurally
inexpressible. The canonical message makes that impossible by
construction: ``action`` is a REQUIRED enum
(:class:`~iab_agentic_primitives.primitives.NegotiationAction`), the money
field is ``buyer_price`` (a
:class:`~iab_agentic_primitives.primitives.Money`, exact micros — FD-11),
and both sides validate against this same model. The
``/proposals/{id}/counter`` route and its bare-``price`` payload are
retired.

Action semantics (buyer's retired verbs map onto the shared enum):

- opening **offer**: ``action="counter"`` with ``negotiation_id=None`` —
  the seller creates the negotiation and mints ``negotiation_id``
- **counter**: ``action="counter"`` with the ``negotiation_id``
- **accept**: ``action="accept"`` — TERMINAL; accepts the counterparty's
  last stated price (``buyer_price`` optional as an echo)
- **decline / walk away**: ``action="reject"`` — TERMINAL; the walk-away
  is recorded as a round on the Negotiation primitive, not silently
  dropped
- **final offer**: ``action="final_offer"`` — a counter flagged as the
  last round before walking away

Termination: once a negotiation's status is ``accepted``, ``rejected``,
or ``expired``, further messages MUST be refused with the
``negotiation_closed`` error code
(:mod:`iab_agentic_primitives.protocol.errors`). Transition rules and the
full state machine are EP-1.4 (``iab_agentic_primitives.state``).

Idempotency (FD-12): every negotiation message can move money and
requires ``idempotency_key`` — a retried counter must not consume an
extra round.
