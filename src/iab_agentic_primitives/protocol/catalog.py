"""Canonical catalog surface: list and detail over ``GET /products``.

Two endpoints, both read-only:

- ``GET /products`` — paginated list; response is
  :class:`ProductListResponse`. Query parameters are the fields of
  :class:`ProductListRequest`.
- ``GET /products/{product_id}`` — detail; response is the
  :class:`~iab_agentic_primitives.primitives.Product` primitive itself
  (no wrapper).

There is explicitly NO ``POST /products/search`` (remediation plan §7
amendment 3). The buyer's OpenDirect-style client posted search filters to
``/products/search`` (buyer ``clients/opendirect_client.py:100``); the
seller never served that route, so every call 405'd. Canonical decision:
the seller returns the full filterable product record in the list
response, and the buyer filters CLIENT-SIDE on the returned fields —
``ad_formats``, ``delivery_type``, ``pricing_model``, ``pricing_type``,
``base_price``, ``available_impressions``, and the three IAB (Interactive
Advertising Bureau) taxonomy targeting blocks. Rich free-text discovery
remains the media-kit search surface, not the catalog.

OpenDirect = the IAB direct-buying API standard.
